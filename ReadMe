    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was going through projects that wanted me to present psudocode and then anazlized this code to see the optimal way this could be done, wither through Hash Table, Binary search tree,
or through vectors. Ultimatly I chose Vectors ro perform these functions as it was fast and effecient while not being a drain on the system as a whole. 

    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
We use data structures to fully understand the problem and the way it should be tackled, it allows for the problem to be optimised and then broken down into its parts to better review and 
face the complexity of the problem

    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When working full time and learning other languages and course information it was difficult to sit down and have time to work on the course work which resulted in some late entires 
but overall I think everthing worked out and I learned the nessesary information and performed well

    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I allowed me to start working a complex problem at work with a diffrent mentalilty and could see the way to break the information down and see how we could automate and optimise

    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure to document what I was thinking and working on at every stage so when I returned I could then know what to do from then to continue what I was doing.
